# Audio-to-Virtual-Cable
Audio to Virtual Cable is a simple script that I have used in the past to play audio when I press a hotkey through a virtual audio cable.
## Considerations
- The audio file you use should be a .ogg file.
- You can adjust the start and stop script buttons by editing the start and end variables.
- I used this [Virtual Audio Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/).
